<p align="center">Okay. Since people are having trouble reading my fucking boundaries regarding my PV skins I am going to make this crystal clear:</p>

<p align="center">I <B><I>HATE</I></B> WHEN PPL TRY TO DO PURELILY WITH ME. white lily skins, if you're going to int, int PLATONICALLY with caution/care when I'm in PV skins. I AM <B><I>NOT YOUR HUSBAND</I></B>.</p>

<p align="center"><I>IF I DON'T KNOW YOU, DO NOT COME UP AND KISS ME FOR ANY SHIPS</I>. I am <B>NOT</B> your lover, weird little freaks ðŸ’€</p>

<p align="center">I adore <B>my gf</B> and being romantic with <I>only her</I>. I adore my friends and <I>PLATONIC</I> or JOKE interactions with them and randos.</p>

<p align="center">I've had THREE experiences that made me uncomfortable where low effort CRK skins acted romantic towards my PV skins. <B><I>Please stop for the love of fucking god</I></B> I am sick of my boundaries being ignored for your fuckass ships.</p>

<p align="center">If people could stop feminizing male characters in front of me that would be really fucking appreciated. I <B><I>HATE</I></B> the sexualization of smaller/thinner male characters. "Just block" I have been and I still see more of them. I need it to <B><I>stop</I></B>.</p>
