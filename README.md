<p align="center">Okay. Since people are having trouble reading my fucking boundaries regarding my PV skins I am going to make this crystal clear:</p>

<p align="center">I HATEEEE WHEN PPL TRY TO DO PURELILY WITH ME. white lily skins, if you're going to int, int PLATONICALLY with caution/care when I'm in PV skins. I AM NOT. YOUR. HUSBAND.</p>

<p align="center">IF I DON'T KNOW YOU, DO NOT COME UP AND KISS ME FOR ANY SHIPS. I am NOT your lover, weird freak ðŸ’€</p>

<p align="center">I adore my gf and being romantic with ONLY HER. I adore my friends and PLATONIC interactions with them and randos.</p>

<p align="center">If I'm in any shadow milk skins I'm usually comfortable with any and all PV skins, but if I'm in PV skins I'm neutral toward shadow milk skins unless they prove to not be weird to me.</p>

<p align="center">I've had THREE experiences that made me uncomfortable where low effort CRK skins acted romantic towards my PV skins. Please stop for the love of fucking god I am sick of the ignorance of boundaries in fandom spaces.</p>
