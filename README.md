<p align="center">I HATE purelily; white lily skins, if you're going to int, int PLATONICALLY with caution/care when I'm in PV skins. I AM NOT YOUR HUSBAND.</p>

<p align="center">Me being friendly with you or accepting an item from you is NOT an invitation for you to act romantic towards me or initiate romantic roleplay of any kind. I am taken and not comfortable with excessive kisses from strangers. I am NOT your lover, weird rando ðŸ’€</p>

<p align="center">I love platonic interactions. I'm not fond of ERP and see it as joking/trolling behavior, but I don't feel as threatened by it as I feel threatened by romantic rp from randos.</p>

<p align="center">If I'm in any shadow milk skins I'm usually comfortable with any and all PV skins, but if I'm in PV skins I'm neutral toward shadow milk skins unless they prove to be nice.</p>

<p align="center">I've had two experiences that made me uncomfortable where low effort CRK skins acted romantic towards my PV skins. Please stop.</p>
