<h3 align="center">I want to share in your joy, I won't be an emotional burden anymore</h3>

<a href="https://rentry.co/intcuddleCRK">the rules</a>
would you, I wrote them for a reason.</p>

<p align="center">When I am PV and sitting alone: Friends int/c+h, Dark Cacao c+h, White Lily FRIENDS ONLY ok to int.</p>

<p align="center">When I am Truthless Recluse and sitting alone: Friends int/c+h, Shadow Milk c+h, Black Sapphire c+h, Candy Apple c+h.</p>

<p align="center">When I am SMC and sitting alone: Friends int/c+h, PV and other shadow milks int/c+h, other beasts int/c+h.</p>

<p align="center">Since people are having trouble reading my fucking boundaries regarding my PV skins I am going to make this crystal clear:</p>

<p align="center">I <B><I>HATE</I></B> WHEN PPL TRY TO DO PURELILY WITH ME. white lily skins, if you're going to int (I recommend white lily skins don't c+h with me when I'm in pv skins, I am not comfortable with even LOOKING like I'm doing purelily), int PLATONICALLY with caution/care. I AM <B><I>NOT YOUR HUSBAND</I></B>.</p>

<p align="center"><I>IF I DON'T KNOW YOU, DO NOT COME UP AND KISS OR ROMANCE ME FOR ANY SHIPS</I>. I am <B>NOT</B> your lover, and I HATE when strangers try to do romantic roleplays with me.</p>

<p align="center">I sometimes prioritize my best friend Rosalie, the person with the purple star/moon/galaxy themed OC named Estella, when she's online. Yes she's my ex gf but still she matters a lot to me. I adore my friends and <I>PLATONIC</I>, PROTECTIVE, or JOKE interactions from them.</p>

<p align="center">I will cuddle with friends as a duo or ship to protect them or myself from weird shippers who ignore boundaries.</p>

<p align="center">I've had FIVE experiences that made me uncomfortable where low effort CRK skins acted romantic/sexual towards my PV skins. <B><I>Please stop for the love of fucking god</I></B> I am sick of my boundaries being ignored by random strangers for ships.</p>

<p align="center">Um how about hell no. /dir</p>
