<p align="center">I HATE purelily so white lily skins are on EXTREMELY thin ice when I'm in PV skins. I AM NOT YOUR HUSBAND, WHITE LILY.</p>

<p align="center">Me being friendly with you or accepting an item from you is NOT an invitation for you to act romantic towards me or initiate romantic roleplay of any kind. I am taken and not comfortable with excessive kisses from strangers. I am NOT your lover, random stranger ðŸ’€</p>

<p align="center">If I'm in any shadow milk skins I'm usually comfortable with any and all PV skins, but if I'm in PV skins I'm neutral toward shadow milk skins unless they prove to be nice.</p>

<p align="center">I've had two bad experiences with low effort CRK skins acting romantic towards my PV skins. Please stop.</p>
